            <h1>European Parliament declares Russia to be a state sponsor of terrorism</h1>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <p>Following the atrocities carried out by Vladimir Putin’s regime against Ukrainian civilians, MEPs have recognised <b> Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.</b></p>

                <p><b>On Wednesday</b>, Parliament adopted a resolution on the latest developments in Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine. MEPs highlight that the deliberate attacks and atrocities committed by Russian forces and their proxies against civilians in Ukraine, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and other serious violations of international and humanitarian law amount to acts of terror and constitute war crimes. In light of this, they recognise Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and as a state that <b> “uses means of terrorism”</b>.</p> 
                <h2>Facts in detail</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia is committing war crimes and uses “means of terrorism”</li>
                    <li>MEPs call for the further international isolation of Russia</li>
                    <li>Close and ban Russian state-affiliated institutions in the EU spreading propaganda</li>
                    <li>The ninth EU sanctions package against Moscow must be completed</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <p><h3>EU legal framework needed</h3>
                    As the EU currently cannot officially designate states as sponsors of terrorism, Parliament calls on the EU and its member states to put in place the proper legal framework and consider adding Russia to such a list. This would trigger a number of significant restrictive measures against Moscow and have profound restrictive implications for EU relations with Russia.
                   <b>In the meantime</b>, MEPs call on the Council to include the Russian paramilitary organisation ‘the Wagner Group’, the 141st Special Motorized Regiment, also known as the <b>“Kadyrovites”</b>, and other Russian-funded armed groups, militias and proxies, on the EU’s terrorist list.</p>
